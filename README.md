# Comfy TypeScript Arcade

Currently only focusing on a minesweeper game with multiplayer capabilities and infrastructure to (feature creep out of existance) expand.

## Start

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Todo

-   Replace board calculation double for loops in minesweeper with same pattern as in Games.ts/directionsToCoordinates
-   User Interface
-   Sessions
-   Handling player data
-   Lobbies and games
-   Linking lobbies and games with the actual games
-   Refactor and clean up code to a presentable and collaboration enabling standard
-   Make infrastructure easy for others to develop for
-   Ensure clean and working deployment/building
